Jessica loves to drive her BMW. She is driving it to the Flughafen. She stops at a ratskeller on the way. But her hund followed her in to play.  She played with her hund in the bar then noticed a tbewerbsfaehig drinking contest. She wanted to join, but first she must eat her brot.  They were all out, so instead she filled up on bratwurst. Then she looked down and noticed a bratwurst stain on her Dirndel.  She quickly realized that she couldn't go to Raesfeld in a state like this. So, she drove home listening to her sorrowful musik. Halfway there, her Klimaanlage suddenly stopped working, adding insult to injury. She drove home to her home, which was a towering old schloss.
